# heditor — creative video editing (Reels and long form)

heditor turns a recording of someone speaking into a short vertical video that holds attention second by second: a strong opening, a visual world built for what is being said, captions synced word by word, sound effects tied to every action, music with an emotional arc and a call to action. Compositions are HTML + GSAP rendered to MP4 by [HyperFrames](https://github.com/heygen-com/hyperframes). Everything runs locally.

The standard is high: **every video gets an edit designed for it.** A style is a proven visual language, never a template to stamp. If two videos in the same batch look like the same mould, the work is not done.

## 0. Setup (once per machine)

```bash
bash <skill_dir>/scripts/setup.sh          # installs ffmpeg/node/python deps if missing, venv, Chrome, fonts, music, SFX, models
. ~/.heditor/env.sh && heditor doctor       # must end with "heditor is ready."
```

- Re-running setup is safe. `--no-audio` skips the Mixkit library; `--whisper small,medium` pre-downloads ASR models.
- Edit `~/.heditor/brand.json` (name, `@handle`, colours, logo path, Follow/Following words, language). Ask the user for these the first time; never invent a handle.
- If a tool cannot be installed automatically (no sudo/package manager), tell the user the exact command to run and stop.
- All commands below assume `. ~/.heditor/env.sh` was sourced. The CLI is `heditor` (also at `<skill_dir>/scripts/heditor`).

## 1. Choose the mode

| User says | Mode | Read |
|---|---|---|
| "edit in style X", "igual ao estilo X" | Fixed style | `references/styles/<slug>.md` |
| "nativo", "edição simples/limpa", "só corta e legenda" | Style `nativo` (the one exception to "different every time": the edit stays invisible) | `references/styles/nativo.md` |
| "creative mode", "modo criativo", "surprise me" | Creative mode | `references/creative-mode.md` |
| "creative mode with/using X" (GTA 6, Wes Anderson, anime, news broadcast…) | Creative mode + reference | `references/creative-mode.md` (§ Reference direction) |
| Nothing specified | Ask once which mode; if the user wants you to decide, use creative mode | |
| "vídeo longo", "aula", "live", "YouTube", "16:9", "editar a aula inteira", chapters, SRT | Long-form mode (any style or creative) | `references/long-form.md` |
| "plano de gravação", "analise os roteiros", "pré-produção", plan before recording | Pre-production: recording plan, teleprompter and edit plan; nothing is edited yet | `references/pre-production.md` |

Named styles (`heditor styles`): see `references/styles/INDEX.md` for when each fits.

| Style | Identity |
|---|---|
| `cinema` | One visual metaphor per speech beat, world changes on each turn, live camera card, kinetic captions |
| `ruptura` | Cold open with the strongest line, the camera itself becomes the metaphor, typographic finale |
| `impacto` | Organised layout with coordinated emphasis bursts (type, sound, zoom) on the key lines |
| `gravidade` | The speech has weight: every key noun is a labelled block that lands on its word (baked Rapier physics, `physkit.land_on`); problems pile up, the turn lands as a heavy block that throws the heap, the answer stacks as a straight tower. Reference build: `heditor new <work> <video> --style gravidade` + `beats.json` |
| `game` | The screen is a retro RPG: HUD, dialog-box captions, skills unlocked, inventory, CONTINUE? CTA |
| `thriller` | Security-camera disaster tape: REC overlay, heartbeat, liquid distortion, blackout, system reboot |
| `trailer` | Suspense/launch trailer: hard cuts between the speaker (cool-steel grade, letterbox) and black, dramatic pauses inserted in the speech with silence before every hit, words on the wall behind the speaker (matte), titles spelled by light, a real object of the set as the date device, layered score with a smash to silence before the climax, poster end card.

| `documentario-narrado` | Large-scale narrated documentary (alias atlas): the speaker narrates history on a living night globe (lights and routes on the words), generated period paintings in 2.5D parallax, dated cards with hard silence → impact → reveal, narrator as film-treated plate / gold medallion / voice-over, "next chapter" loop |
| `podcast` | Talk show / podcast: saturated set, ON AIR sign, voice-reactive waveform, giant karaoke captions |
| `missao` | Open-world game homage: sunset neon world, in-world social clip, character intro freeze-frame, mission card, GPS route, stats screen, mission-complete banner, phone-chat CTA |
| `tribunal` | Courtroom sketch: the speaker as expert witness on the court monitor, typed testimony captions, exhibits and stamps, a verdict, the jury is the viewer |
| `keynote` | Ad · launch stage: presenter cutout in front of a giant LED screen, slides and stage objects per sentence, deadline close-up, "Learn more" slide |
| `stories` | Ad · behind the scenes as a sequence of stories: progress bars, tap and cube swipe, hand-made stickers, "Learn more" link sticker |
| `predio-24h` | Ad · isometric company model with a day/night cycle: floors light per department, server cutaway, 24 h orbit, second tower for the offer |
| `bilheteria` | Ad · retro box office: numbered tickets, the clerk's arched window, a ticket ruler that gains golden extras, golden ticket, turnstile that lets the viewer in |
| `porta-de-aco` | Ad · shop front at night: steel shutter descending at each turn, neon signs, "you take" window, closed shutter as the CTA |
| `lapidacao` | Ad · luxury jewellery commercial: the tool is closed and the room goes dark, the raw material drops as a rough stone, the cut (laser, facets, flash) reveals the gem with its parts named, a loupe reviews the machine's work, a tray locks the unsaid steps, the offer case slams shut on the warning, sealed date tag, velvet rope CTA, louder score. Reference build: `heditor new <work> <video> --style lapidacao` + `beats.json` |
| `manual-de-montagem` | Ad · assembly manual on a blueprint: numbered parts that snap in, same parts in every project, assembly at the turn, kit box |
| `carrinho` | Ad · forgotten cart in a shopping app: push notification, items fall into the cart, bonuses as gifts, checkout CTA |
| `entrega` | Ad · order tracking: the timeline jumps to "delivered now", a box opens and items fly into the checklist |
| `auditorio` | Ad · TV quiz show: each question is a round, A/B answers light green, scoreboard, velvet doors open for the CTA |

### Long-form mode (classes, lives, YouTube; any format)

For minutes to hours of video in 16:9 (also 16:9 4K, 1:1, 4:5, 9:16), follow `references/long-form.md`:
`heditor new --long <work> <video> --format 16:9 --style <slug|creative> --kind aula|live|youtube` →
`heditor long transcribe` (chunked, resumable ASR) → `long edl` (proposed cuts of dead pauses, false starts,
repetitions and fillers, reviewed before applying) → `long apply` → `long chapters` → `long layouts` (screen +
camera layouts: pip, screen with zoom, speaker, side) → `long produce` (style pack, set pieces, captions, lower
thirds, intro/CTA, mix) → `long preview` → `heditor test` → `long render` (segmented, resumable) → `long finalize`
(one continuous master audio, SRT/VTT, YouTube chapters, QA report). Every named style is available as a *style
pack* (`heditor long styles`); creative mode lives in set pieces at key moments. Format profiles: `heditor formats`.

### Layered effects (any mode)

Text and objects *behind* the speaker, captions painted on a wall, 3D objects passing between the speaker and the room, depth fog, contour scans, point clouds and objects that follow the hands come from depthkit: `heditor matte|depth|look|hands|plane <work>` (models download on first use). Read `references/depth-and-3d.md` before using them in any style or in creative mode; layouts, illustrations, hooks and CTAs borrowed from creator Reels are in `references/technique-catalogue.md`.

### Motion tools (any mode)

- **GSAP plugins offline:** SplitText, DrawSVG, MorphSVG, MotionPath, CustomEase/Bounce/Wiggle, Text, Physics2D/Props and EasePack ship with setup; load them with `rk.page(..., plugins=("SplitText", "DrawSVG"))`. Read `references/gsap-craft.md` first: some GSAP features call `Math.random` (ScrambleText, `stagger from: "random"`, `gsap.utils.random`) and break the render; the kit has seeded replacements (`rnd()`, `scramble()`).
- **SVG preparation:** `heditor svg <in.svg> [out.svg] [static|draw|morph]` cleans exported SVGs with SVGO for the animation they will get and proves, pixel by pixel in the render Chrome, that they still look the same.
- **Real physics:** `heditor physics` / `physkit` bakes a Rapier rigid-body simulation (falling piles, impacts, blasts) into per-frame transforms that a three.js layer with bloom and depth of field reads at any time. Recipe, framing and look values in `references/physics-3d.md`; working pilot in `templates/physics/pilot_build.py`.
- **Styles built on these tools:** `gravidade` (physics: blocks land on their words, `physkit.land_on`) and `circuito` (DrawSVG, MorphSVG, MotionPath, SplitText on a circuit board). Both ship a reference build: `heditor new <work> <video> --style gravidade|circuito`, write `<work>/beats.json` from the speech (format in the style file and at the top of the build), then `heditor produce`. In creative mode, borrow their engines (`board()`, `physics()`) for a single set piece.

## 2. Workflow (all modes)

Follow `references/workflow.md` step by step. Summary:

1. **Probe the source.** `heditor probe <video> 5 60 300` and look at the frames: where is the speaker (full frame, webcam tile in a meeting, screen share)? Note resolution, the speaker crop, what else is on screen.
2. **Transcribe and choose the cut.** `heditor transcribe <video> 0 <duration> qa/asr-full.json` (or a window). Pick a self-contained argument of 30–70 s: hook → thesis → explanation → conclusion. Long-form stories (e.g. a narrated documentary of ~90 s, style `documentario-narrado`) are allowed when requested: declare `max_duration` in the plan (≤ 180 s) so `heditor test` accepts them, and keep a retention device every few seconds. The hook must exist in the speech. Never invent, reorder words inside a sentence, speed up or splice half-sentences into a new claim. Remove repetitions, false starts and tangents only at clean word boundaries.
3. **Scaffold and prepare.** `heditor new <work> <video>`, fill `BLOCKS`/`CROP` in `<work>/prepare.py`, `heditor prepare <work>`, `heditor gaps <work>` (no pause > 0.45 s), then `heditor words <work>` and fix spelling/brand names in `words-reviewed.json` (timings untouched; profanity can be masked on screen only).
4. **Design first.** Fill `<work>/DESIGN.md`: video analysis, mode/style, frame map, palette, captions, beat sheet with timestamps, music, CTA, risks. In creative mode, research before designing.
5. **Build.** Rewrite `<work>/build.py` (the template is only a runnable baseline) to implement DESIGN.md. Use the kit (`references/kit-api.md`) or write your own HTML when the format needs it.
6. **Produce.** Pick the mix profile (`voice` or `presence`), profile the track with `heditor music <music:ID|file>` and place its turns on the speech turns; `heditor produce <work> music:<id> <drop_s>` → composition + mix; read the `balance` it prints (targets, `music_gaps`).
7. **QA before render.** `heditor lint <work>` (0 errors) → `heditor preview <work> <18–24 times>` → inspect the contact sheet with vision and fix every defect → `heditor test <work>`. Gates in `references/quality-gates.md`.
8. **Render and finalize.** `heditor render <work>` → `heditor finalize <work> <name>.mp4` → review `qa/final-contact-sheet.jpg` and `qa/final-verification.json` → `heditor asr-check <work>`.
9. **Deliver** the MP4 path with a short summary (format, music, what was verified, what nobody has checked: nobody has *listened* to it — say so). Never publish to social networks unless the user explicitly asks.
10. **Learn.** If you created a new style that the user liked, add it as a named style (`references/adding-styles.md`).

## 3. Non-negotiables

- **No dead air.** Inspect pauses inside blocks and across every junction, using the assembled clean voice, not the music mix. Run `heditor gaps` after prepare and check the surrounding words. The default 0.45 s threshold flags candidates for revision; it does not authorize clipping consonants, removing every breath or flattening deliberate rhetorical pauses. Preserve speech at 1× and shorten unwanted dead air with small safety margins. Document any intentional longer pause and verify the exception explicitly before rendering. For a pause-only revision of an approved edit, preserve its visual language and previous version, remap captions, media and SFX to the new timeline, then verify the exported MP4.
- **Voice first, music present.** Mix profile by delivery (`plan["mix"]`): `voice` (default; organic Reels, class excerpts) music ≈ 21.5 dB under the voice (median), background ≥ 12 dB under at p95; `presence` (paid ads, creative mode, trailer) music ≈ 15 dB under, background p95 ≥ 7 dB under, filtered sections with make-up gain and `heditor asr-check` required. In both the bed may not vanish inside the speech (`test_music_presence`). Impacts in the gaps, ducking held across the whole phrase. -14 LUFS, true peak ≤ -1.5 dBTP after AAC.
- **Readable captions.** Every spoken word, synced; active word with high contrast (black on light yellow, white on saturated dark — never dark-on-mid or dark outline on dark text). Check enlarged crops.
- **Safe zones.** (9:16; every format profile has its own safe area, see `long-form.md`.) Nothing important above y = 270 (top 14%; titles with accents start ≥ 300), keep the bottom ~350 px and the right edge (~120 px, y 1000–1700) free of critical info, never cover the face.
- **Truth.** Numbers, names and claims exactly as spoken; no invented stats, testimonials, promises or private data; no third-party logos or copyrighted assets (homage through type, colour, motion, sound).
- **Licences.** Fonts OFL (google/fonts), icons Lucide, music/SFX from the catalog (Mixkit Free License) or user-provided licensed files. Record provenance in DESIGN.md.
- **Different every time.** In a batch, give each video its own format (layout, camera treatment, captions, palette, transitions, music, CTA). Ask vision to compare contact sheets: "do these look like the same template?" If yes, change more.
- **Verify before claiming.** A video is done only after lint, previews, tests, render, finalize gates and contact-sheet review pass. Report what failed honestly.

## 4. References

- `references/workflow.md` — the full procedure with commands, cut selection and EDL rules.
- `references/pre-production.md` — before recording: measure the scripts, inventory the set, reuse existing screen recordings, fact-check cited studies, recording plan (setups, gestures on words, screens, inserts), teleprompter generated from the source and a per-video style map for a batch.
- `references/long-form.md` — long-form mode: format profiles, layouts, EDL proposal, chapters, style packs for all styles, creative set pieces and cadence, segmented render, QA.
- `references/creative-mode.md` — creative mode, reference-directed creative mode, research method, idea bank.
- `references/kit-api.md` — reelkit functions, page skeleton, GSAP helpers, plan/sound/music formats.
- `references/depth-and-3d.md` — depthkit: speaker matte, depth map, scans, planes, tracking, three.js, layered recipes and QA.
- `references/gsap-craft.md` — GSAP plugins available offline, seek-safety rules (determinism hazards inside GSAP), SplitText/DrawSVG/MorphSVG in a render, SVG preparation with `heditor svg`.
- `references/physics-3d.md` — physkit: baked Rapier physics, scene format, three.js page with bloom/depth of field, look values and framing that passed QA.
- `references/technique-catalogue.md` — creator layouts (A/B page, morphs, insets, bands), illustrations, camera moves, caption systems, hooks and CTAs.
- `references/sound-design.md` — voice chain, mix targets, SFX vocabulary, music catalog and section design.
- `references/captions-and-layout.md` — caption systems, contrast rules, safe zones, camera treatments.

- `references/licenses.md` — third-party components and asset licences.
- `references/styles/` — one file per named style.

## 5. Changing heditor itself

Every change pushed to `main` ships as a version, never as a loose commit:

1. Bump `metadata.version` in this file (semver: patch for fixes and docs, minor for styles, commands and features, major for breaking changes).
2. Add a `## X.Y.Z — YYYY-MM-DD` section at the top of `CHANGELOG.md`.
3. Commit as `heditor X.Y.Z: <summary>`, push to `main` and wait for CI to pass on that commit.
4. Create the annotated tag and the GitHub release with that CHANGELOG section as notes:
   `git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m "heditor X.Y.Z: <summary>" && git push origin vX.Y.Z`
   `gh release create vX.Y.Z --verify-tag --title "heditor X.Y.Z: <summary>" --notes-file <notes.md> --latest`
5. Read it back: `gh release view vX.Y.Z` shows the release as Latest and `git ls-remote --tags origin` lists the tag.
